              "\"Hey everyone, Grant here.This is the first video in a series on the essence of calculus,and I'll be publishing the following videos once per day for the next 10 days.The goal here, as the name suggests, is to really getthe heart of the subject out in one binge-watchable set.But with a topic that's as broad as calculus, there's a lot of things that can mean,so here's what I have in mind specifically.Calculus has a lot of rules and formulas whichare often presented as things to be memorized.Lots of derivative formulas, the product rule, the chain rule,implicit differentiation, the fact that integrals and derivatives are opposite,Taylor series, just a lot of things like that.And my goal is for you to come away feeling likeyou could have invented calculus yourself.That is, cover all those core ideas, but in a way that makes clear where theyactually come from, and what they really mean, using an all-around visual approach.Inventing math is no joke, and there is a difference between beingtold why something's true, and actually generating it from scratch.But at all points, I want you to think to yourself, if you were an early mathematician,pondering these ideas and drawing out the right diagrams,does it feel reasonable that you could have stumbled across these truths yourself?In this initial video, I want to show how you might stumble into the core ideas ofcalculus by thinking very deeply about one specific bit of geometry,the area of a circle.Maybe you know that this is pi times its radius squared, but why?Is there a nice way to think about where this formula comes from?Well, contemplating this problem and leaving yourself open to exploring theinteresting thoughts that come about can actually lead you to a glimpse of threebig ideas in calculus, integrals, derivatives, and the fact that they're opposites.But the story starts more simply, just you and a circle, let's say with radius 3.You're trying to figure out its area, and after going through a lot ofpaper trying different ways to chop up and rearrange the pieces of that area,many of which might lead to their own interesting observations,maybe you try out the idea of slicing up the circle into many concentric rings.This should seem promising because it respects the symmetry of the circle,and math has a tendency to reward you when you respect its symmetries.Let's take one of those rings, which has some inner radius r that's between 0 and 3.If we can find a nice expression for the area of each ring like this one,and if we have a nice way to add them all up,it might lead us to an understanding of the full circle's area.Maybe you start by imagining straightening out this ring.And you could try thinking through exactly what this new shape is and what itsarea should be, but for simplicity, let's just approximate it as a rectangle.The width of that rectangle is the circumference of the original ring,which is 2 pi times r, right?I mean, that's essentially the definition of pi.And its thickness?Well, that depends on how finely you chopped up the circle in the first place,which was kind of arbitrary.In the spirit of using what will come to be standard calculus notation,let's call that thickness dr for a tiny difference in the radius from one ring tothe next.Maybe you think of it as something like 0.1.So approximating this unwrapped ring as a thin rectangle,its area is 2 pi times r, the radius, times dr, the little thickness.And even though that's not perfect, for smaller and smaller choices of dr,this is actually going to be a better and better approximation for that area,since the top and the bottom sides of this shape are going to get closer and closer tobeing exactly the same length.So let's just move forward with this approximation,keeping in the back of our minds that it's slightly wrong,but it's going to become more accurate for smaller and smaller choices of dr.That is, if we slice up the circle into thinner and thinner rings.So just to sum up where we are, you've broken up the area of the circle intoall of these rings, and you're approximating the area of each one of those as2 pi times its radius times dr, where the specific value for that inner radiusranges from 0 for the smallest ring up to just under 3 for the biggest ring,spaced out by whatever the thickness is that you choose for dr, something like 0.1.And notice that the spacing between the values here corresponds to thethickness dr of each ring, the difference in radius from one ring to the next.In fact, a nice way to think about the rectangles approximating eachring's area is to fit them all upright side by side along this axis.Each one has a thickness dr, which is why they fit so snugly right there together,and the height of any one of these rectangles sitting above some specific value of r,like 0.6, is exactly 2 pi times that value.That's the circumference of the corresponding ring that this rectangle approximates.Pictures like this 2 pi r can get tall for the screen,I mean 2 times pi times 3 is around 19, so let's just throw up a y axis that'sscaled a little differently so that we can actually fit all of these rectangleson the screen.A nice way to think about this setup is to draw the graph of 2 pi r,which is a straight line that has a slope 2 pi.Each of these rectangles extends up to the point where it just barely touches that graph.Again, we're being approximate here.Each of these rectangles only approximates thearea of the corresponding ring from the circle.But remember, that approximation, 2 pi r times dr,gets less and less wrong as the size of dr gets smaller and smaller.And this has a very beautiful meaning when we'relooking at the sum of the areas of all those rectangles.For smaller and smaller choices of dr, you might at firstthink that turns the problem into a monstrously large sum.I mean, there's many many rectangles to consider,and the decimal precision of each one of their areas is going to be anabsolute nightmare.But notice, all of their areas in aggregate just looks like the area under a graph.And that portion under the graph is just a triangle,a triangle with a base of 3 and a height that's 2 pi times 3.So its area, 1 half base times height, works out to be exactly pi times 3 squared.Or if the radius of our original circle was some other value,capital R, that area comes out to be pi times r squared.And that's the formula for the area of a circle.It doesn't matter who you are or what you typically think of math,that right there is a beautiful argument.But if you want to think like a mathematician here,you don't just care about finding the answer,you care about developing general problem-solving tools and techniques.So take a moment to meditate on what exactly just happened and why it worked,because the way we transitioned from something approximate to somethingprecise is actually pretty subtle and cuts deep to what calculus is all about.You had this problem that could be approximated with the sum of many small numbers,each of which looked like 2 pi r times dr, for values of r ranging between 0 and 3.Remember, the small number dr here represents our choice for the thickness of each ring,for example 0.1.And there are two important things to note here.First of all, not only is dr a factor in the quantities we're adding up,2 pi r times dr, it also gives the spacing between the different values of r.And secondly, the smaller our choice for dr, the better the approximation.Adding all of those numbers could be seen in a different,pretty clever way as adding the areas of many thin rectanglessitting underneath a graph, the graph of the function 2 pi r in this case.Then, and this is key, by considering smaller and smaller choices for dr,corresponding to better and better approximations of the original problem, the sum,thought of as the aggregate area of those rectangles,approaches the area under the graph.And because of that, you can conclude that the answer to the original question,in full unapproximated precision, is exactly the same as the area underneath this graph.A lot of other hard problems in math and science can be broken down andapproximated as the sum of many small quantities,like figuring out how far a car has traveled based on its velocity at each point in time.In a case like that, you might range through many different points in time,and at each one multiply the velocity at that time times a tiny change in time, dt,which would give the corresponding little bit of distance traveled during that littletime.I'll talk through the details of examples like this later in the series,but at a high level many of these types of problems turn out to be equivalentto finding the area under some graph, in much the same way that our circle problem did.This happens whenever the quantities you're adding up,the one whose sum approximates the original problem,can be thought of as the areas of many thin rectangles sitting side by side.If finer and finer approximations of the original problem correspond to thinner andthinner rings, then the original problem is equivalent to finding the area under somegraph.Again, this is an idea we'll see in more detail later in the series,so don't worry if it's not 100% clear right now.The point now is that you, as the mathematician having justsolved a problem by reframing it as the area under a graph,might start thinking about how to find the areas under other graphs.We were lucky in the circle problem that the relevant area turned out to be a triangle,but imagine instead something like a parabola, the graph of x2.What's the area underneath that curve, say betweenthe values of x equals 0 and x equals 3?Well, it's hard to think about, right?And let me reframe that question in a slightly different way.We'll fix that left endpoint in place at 0, and let the right endpoint vary.Are you able to find a function, a of x, that givesyou the area under this parabola between 0 and x?A function a of x like this is called an integral of x2.Calculus holds within it the tools to figure out what an integral like this is,but right now it's just a mystery function to us.We know it gives the area under the graph of x2 between some fixed leftpoint and some variable right point, but we don't know what it is.And again, the reason we care about this kind of question is not just forthe sake of asking hard geometry questions, it's because many practicalproblems that can be approximated by adding up a large number of smallthings can be reframed as a question about an area under a certain graph.I'll tell you right now that finding this area, this integral function,is genuinely hard, and whenever you come across a genuinely hard question in math,a good policy is to not try too hard to get at the answer directly,since usually you just end up banging your head against a wall.Instead, play around with the idea, with no particular goal in mind.Spend some time building up familiarity with the interplay between the functiondefining the graph, in this case x2, and the function giving the area.In that playful spirit, if you're lucky, here's something you might notice.When you slightly increase x by some tiny nudge dx, look at the resulting change in area,represented with this sliver I'm going to call da for a tiny difference in area.That sliver can be pretty well approximated with a rectangle,one whose height is x2 and whose width is dx.And the smaller the size of that nudge dx, themore that sliver actually looks like a rectangle.This gives us an interesting way to think about how a of x is related to x2.A change to the output of a, this little da, is about equal to x2,where x is whatever input you started at, times dx,the little nudge to the input that caused a to change.Or rearranged, da divided by dx, the ratio of a tiny change in a to the tinychange in x that caused it, is approximately whatever x2 is at that point.And that's an approximation that should get betterand better for smaller and smaller choices of dx.In other words, we don't know what a of x is, that remains a mystery.But we do know a property that this mystery function must have.When you look at two nearby points, for example 3 and 3.001,consider the change to the output of a between those two points,the difference between the mystery function evaluated at 3.001 and 3.001.That change, divided by the difference in the input values, which in this case is 0.001,should be about equal to the value of x2 for the starting input, in this case 3 squared.And this relationship between tiny changes to the mystery functionand the values of x2 itself is true at all inputs, not just 3.That doesn't immediately tell us how to find a of x,but it provides a very strong clue that we can work with.And there's nothing special about the graph x2 here.Any function defined as the area under some graph has this property,that da divided by dx, a slight nudge to the output of a divided by a slightnudge to the input that caused it, is about equal to the height of the graph atthat point.Again, that's an approximation that gets better and better for smaller choices of dx.And here, we're stumbling into another big idea from calculus, derivatives.This ratio da divided by dx is called the derivative of a, or more technically,the derivative is whatever this ratio approaches as dx gets smaller and smaller.I'll dive much more deeply into the idea of a derivative in the next video,but loosely speaking it's a measure of how sensitive a function is to small changes inits input.You'll see as the series goes on that there are many ways you can visualize a derivative,depending on what function you're looking at and how you thinkabout tiny nudges to its output.We care about derivatives because they help us solve problems,and in our little exploration here, we already have a glimpse of one way they're used.They are the key to solving integral questions,problems that require finding the area under a curve.Once you gain enough familiarity with computing derivatives,you'll be able to look at a situation like this one where you don't know what a functionis, but you do know that its derivative should be x2,and from that reverse engineer what the function must be.This back and forth between integrals and derivatives,where the derivative of a function for the area under a graph gives youback the function defining the graph itself, is called the fundamentaltheorem of calculus.It ties together the two big ideas of integrals and derivatives,and shows how each one is an inverse of the other.All of this is only a high-level view, just a peekat some of the core ideas that emerge in calculus.And what follows in this series are the details, for derivatives and integrals and more.At all points, I want you to feel that you could have invented calculus yourself,that if you drew the right pictures and played with each idea in just the right way,these formulas and rules and constructs that are presented could have justas easily popped out naturally from your own explorations.And before you go, it would feel wrong not to give the people who supported thisseries on Patreon a well-deserved thanks, both for their financial backing aswell as for the suggestions they gave while the series was being developed.You see, supporters got early access to the videos as I made them,and they'll continue to get early access for future essence-of type series.And as a thanks to the community, I keep ads off of new videos for their first month.I'm still astounded that I can spend time working on videos like these,and in a very direct way, you are the one to thank for that.\""

            "Hey Everyone, Grant here.This is the first video in a series on the essence of calculus,and I'll be publishing the following videos once per day for the next 10 days.The Goal here, as the name suggests,, is to really getthe heart of the subject out in one binge-watchable set.But With a topic that's as broad as calculus,, there's a lot of things that can mean,so here's what I have in mind specifically.Calculus has a lot of rules and formulas, whichare often presented as things to be memorized.Lots of derivative formulas, the product rule, the chain rule,implicit differentiation, the fact that integrals and derivatives are opposite,Taylor series, just a lot of things like that.And My goal is for you to come away feeling likeyou could have invented calculus yourself.That is, cover all those core ideas, but in a way that makes clear where theyactually come from, and what they really mean, using an all-around visual approach.Inventing Math is no joke, and there is a difference between beingtold why something's true, and actually generating it from scratch.But At all points, I Want you to think to yourself, if you were an early mathematician,pondering these ideas and drawing out the right diagrams,does, it feel reasonable that you could have stumbled across these truths yourself?In This initial video, I Want to show how you might stumble into the core ideas ofcalculus by thinking very deeply about one specific bit of geometry,the area of a circle.Maybe You know that this is Pi times its radius squared, but why?Is There a nice way to think about where this formula comes from?Well, contemplating this problem and leaving yourself open to exploring theinteresting thoughts that come about can actually lead you to a glimpse of threebig ideas in calculus, integrals, derivatives, and the fact that they're opposites.But The story starts more simply, just you and a circle, let's say with radius 3.You're trying to figure out its area, and after going through a lot ofpaper trying different ways to chop up and rearrange the pieces of that area,many of which might lead to their own interesting observations,maybe, you try out the idea of slicing up the circle into many concentric rings.This. should seem promising because it respects the symmetry of the circle,and math has a tendency to reward you when you respect its symmetries.Let's. take one of those rings, which has some inner radius r that's between 0 and 3.If We can find a nice expression for the area of each ring like this one,and, if we have a nice way to add them all up,it might lead us to an understanding of the full circle's area.Maybe. You start by imagining straightening out this ring.And You could try thinking through exactly what this new shape is and what itsarea should be, but for simplicity,, let's just approximate it as a rectangle.The. Width of that rectangle is the circumference of the original ring,which is 2 Pi times r, right?I Mean, that's essentially the definition of Pi.and its thickness?Well, that depends on how finely you chopped up the circle in the first place,which was kind of arbitrary.In The spirit of using what will come to be standard calculus notation,let's, call that thickness dr. for a tiny difference in the radius from one ring tothe next.Maybe. You think of it as something like 0.1.So Approximating this unwrapped ring as a thin rectangle,its area is 2 Pi times r, the radius, times Dr,. the little thickness.And Even though that's not perfect,, for smaller and smaller choices of Dr,this. is actually going to be a better and better approximation for that area,since the top and the bottom sides of this shape are going to get closer and closer tobeing exactly the same length.So. Let's just move forward with this approximation,keeping in the back of our minds that it's slightly wrong,but, it's going to become more accurate for smaller and smaller choices of Dr.that. is, if we slice up the circle into thinner and thinner rings.So Just to sum up where we are,, you've broken up the area of the circle intoall of these rings, and you're approximating the area of each one of those As2 Pi times its radius times Dr,. where the specific value for that inner radiusranges from 0 for the smallest ring up to just under 3 for the biggest ring,spaced out by whatever the thickness is that you choose for Dr,. something like 0.1.And Notice that the spacing between the values here corresponds to thethickness dr of each ring, the difference in radius from one ring to the next.In Fact,, a nice way to think about the rectangles approximating eachring's area is to fit them all upright side by side along this axis.Each One has a thickness Dr, which is why they fit so snugly right there together,and the height of any one of these rectangles sitting above some specific value of r,like 0.6, is exactly 2 Pi times that value.That's the circumference of the corresponding ring that this rectangle approximates.Pictures Like this, 2 Pi r can get tall for the screen,I mean 2 times Pi times 3 is around 19,. so let's just throw up a Y axis that'sscaled a little differently so that we can actually fit all of these rectangleson the screen.A Nice way to think about this setup is to draw the graph of 2 Pi r,which is a straight line that has a slope 2 Pi.each of these rectangles extends up to the point where it just barely touches that graph.Again, we're being approximate here.Each of these rectangles only approximates thearea of the corresponding ring from the circle.But Remember,, that approximation, 2 Pi r times Dr,gets. less and less wrong as the size of Dr gets smaller and smaller.And This has a very beautiful meaning when we'relooking at the sum of the areas of all those rectangles.For Smaller and smaller choices of Dr,. you might at firstthink that. turns the problem into a monstrously large sum.I Mean,, there's many, many rectangles to consider,and the decimal precision of each one of their areas is going to be anabsolute nightmare.But Notice,, all of their areas in aggregate just looks like the area under a graph.And That portion under the graph is just a triangle,a triangle with a base of 3 and a height that's 2 Pi times 3.So Its area, 1 half base times height, works out to be exactly Pi times 3 squared.Or If the radius of our original circle was some other value,capital R, that area comes out to be Pi times r squared.And That's the formula for the area of a circle.It Doesn't matter who you are or what you typically think of math,that right? there is a beautiful argument.But If you want to think like a mathematician here,you, don't just care about finding the answer,you, care about developing general problem-solving tools and techniques.So Take a moment to meditate on what exactly just happened and why it worked,because the way we transitioned from something approximate to somethingprecise is actually pretty subtle and cuts deep to what calculus is all about.You. Had this problem that could be approximated with the sum of many small numbers,each of which looked like 2 Pi r times Dr,. for values of R ranging between 0 and 3.Remember, the small number Dr here represents our choice for the thickness of each ring,for example, 0.1.And There are two important things to note here.First Of all,, not only is Dr a factor in the quantities we're adding up,2 Pi r times Dr,. it also gives the spacing between the different values of r.And Secondly,, the smaller our choice for Dr,. the better the approximation.Adding All of those numbers could be seen in a different,pretty, clever way as adding the areas of many thin rectanglessitting underneath a graph, the graph of the function 2 Pi r in this case.Then, And this is key, by considering smaller and smaller choices for Dr,corresponding. to better and better approximations of the original problem,, the sum,thought of as the aggregate area of those rectangles,approaches the area under the graph.And Because of that,, you can conclude that the answer to the original question,in full unapproximated precision, is exactly the same as the area underneath this graph.A Lot of other hard problems in math and science can be broken down andapproximated as the sum of many small quantities,like figuring out how far a car has traveled based on its velocity at each point in time.In. A case like that,, you might range through many different points in time,and at each one, multiply the velocity at that time times a tiny change in time, Dt,which would give the corresponding little bit of distance traveled during that littletime.I'll talk through the details of examples like this later in the series,but, at a high level, many of these types of problems turn out to be equivalentto finding the area under some graph, in much the same way that our circle problem did.This happens whenever the quantities you're adding up,the one whose sum approximates the original problem,can be thought of as the areas of many thin rectangles sitting side by side.If Finer and finer approximations of the original problem correspond to thinner andthinner rings,. Then the original problem is equivalent to finding the area under somegraph.Again, This is an idea we'll see in more detail later in the series,so don't worry if it's not 100% clear right now.The. Point Now is that you, as the mathematician having justsolved a problem by reframing it as the area under a graph,might start thinking about how to find the areas under other graphs.We Were lucky in the circle problem that the relevant area turned out to be a triangle,but imagine instead something like a parabola, the graph of x2.What's. the area underneath that curve, say betweenthe values of X equals 0 and X equals 3?Well, it's hard to think about, right?And Let me reframe that question in a slightly different way.We'll fix that left endpoint in place at 0, and let the right endpoint vary.Are You able to find a function, A of X, that givesyou the area under this parabola between 0 and X?a Function A of X Like this is called an integral of X2.calculus holds within it the tools to figure out what an integral like this is,but, right now it's just a mystery function to us.We Know it gives the area under the graph of X2 between some fixed leftpoint and some variable right point,, but we don't know what it is.And Again,, the reason we care about this kind of question is not just forthe sake of asking hard geometry questions,, it's because many practicalproblems that can be approximated by adding up a large number of smallthings can be reframed as a question about an area under a certain graph.I'll tell you right now that finding this area, this integral function,is genuinely hard, and whenever you come across a genuinely hard question in math,a good policy is to not try too hard to get at the answer directly,since usually you just end up banging your head against a wall.Instead, play around with the idea, with no particular goal in mind.Spend Some time building up familiarity with the interplay between the functiondefining the graph, in this case X2, and the function giving the area.In That playful spirit, if you're lucky,, here's something you might notice.When: You slightly increase X by some tiny nudge dx,. look at the resulting change in area,represented with this sliver. I'm going to call Da for a tiny difference in area.That Sliver can be pretty well approximated with a rectangle,one whose height is X2 and whose width is Dx.and. The smaller, the size of that nudge dx, themore. that sliver actually looks like a rectangle.This. gives us an interesting way to think about how A of X is related to X2.a change to the output of A, this little da, is about equal to X2,where X is whatever input you started at, times dx,the little nudge to the input that caused a to change.Or rearranged, Da divided by dx, the ratio of a tiny change in A to the tinychange in X that caused it, is approximately whatever X2 is at that point.And That's an approximation that should get betterand better for smaller and smaller choices of Dx.in Other words,, we don't know what A of X is, That remains a mystery.But We do know a property that this mystery function must have.When You look at two nearby points, for example 3 and 3.001,consider the change to the output of A. Between those two points,the, difference between the mystery function evaluated at 3.001 and 3.001.That change, divided by the difference in the input values, which in this case is 0.001,should be about equal to the value of X2 for the starting input, in this case 3 squared.And This relationship between tiny changes to the mystery functionand the values of X2 itself is true at all inputs,, not just 3.That doesn't immediately tell us how to find A of X,but it provides a very strong clue that we can work with.And There's nothing special about the graph X2 here.Any Function defined as the area under some graph has this property,that Da divided by Dx, a slight nudge to the output of A, divided by a slightnudge to the input that caused it, is about equal to the height of the graph atthat point.Again, that's an approximation that gets better and better for smaller choices of Dx.and Here, we're stumbling into another big idea from calculus, derivatives.This. ratio Da divided by Dx is called the derivative of A, or more technically,the, derivative is whatever. this ratio approaches as Dx gets smaller and smaller.I'll dive much more deeply into the idea of a derivative in the next video,but loosely speaking, it's a measure of how sensitive a function is to small changes inits input.You'll see as the series goes on that there are many ways you can visualize a derivative,depending on what function you're looking at and how you thinkabout tiny nudges to its output.We. Care about derivatives because they help us solve problems,and in our little exploration here, we already have a glimpse of one way they're used.They. are the key to solving integral questions,problems that require finding the area under a curve.Once You gain enough familiarity with computing derivatives,you'll be able to look at a situation like this one where you don't know what a functionis, but you do know that its derivative should be X2,and from that, reverse engineer what the function must be.This. Back and forth between integrals and derivatives,where the derivative of a function for the area under a graph gives youback the function defining the graph itself, is called the fundamentaltheorem of calculus.It. ties together the two big ideas of integrals and derivatives,and shows how each one is an inverse of the other.All of this is only a high-level view, just a peekat some of the core ideas that emerge in calculus.And. What follows in this series are the details, for derivatives and integrals and more.At. All points, I Want you to feel that you could have invented calculus yourself,that if you drew the right pictures and played with each idea in just the right way,these, formulas and rules and constructs that are presented could have justas easily popped out naturally from your own explorations.And. Before you go,, it would feel wrong not to give the people who supported thisseries on Patreon a well-deserved thanks, both for their financial backing aswell, as for the suggestions they gave while the series was being developed.You See,, supporters got early access to the videos as I made them,and they'll continue to get early access for future essence-of type series.And As a thanks to the community, I keep ads off of new videos for their first month.I'm still astounded that I can spend time working on videos like these,and in a very direct way, you are the one to thank for that.\n"

            "This video series aims to explain the core concepts of calculus intuitively, focusing on understanding rather than memorization.  The first video uses the area of a circle as a starting point.  By approximating the circle's area using concentric rings and treating each ring as a rectangle, the concept of integration emerges as summing the areas of these rectangles.  As the width of the rings (dr) approaches zero, the sum of the rectangular areas approximates the area under the curve 2πr, which is a triangle, yielding the familiar formula for the area of a circle (πr²).\n",
            "\n",
            "This process introduces the idea of integrals and their connection to the area under a curve.  The video then explores the relationship between a function (like x²) and the area under its curve.  By considering a tiny change in the area (da) resulting from a small change in x (dx), the concept of a derivative (da/dx) is introduced as a measure of the function's sensitivity to small changes in its input.  The video highlights that the derivative of the function representing the area under a curve is the original function itself, illustrating the fundamental theorem of calculus.  The series promises to further explore these concepts and other core ideas of calculus in a visually intuitive way.\n",
